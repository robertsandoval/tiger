tiger create install 
	- create install dir
tiger status - list all clusters (that have a tfstate file. could integrate api call into aws possibly)
tiger set binary
	- list versions available
	- set openshift-install, oc, kubectl to version set
	- set up user based bash_completions





Later
tiger destroy install - clean up install directory and delete. should fail if tfstate file is there.
